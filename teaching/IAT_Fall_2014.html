<h1>Introduction to algebraic topology, fall 2014</h1>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

The planning of the course is as follows. There will be 13 meetings : 9:00-10:45 of every Thursday morning from Sep. 4th to Dec. 11th, except Oct. 2nd, Nov. 6th and <span style="color:red">Dec. 4th</span>.
The meetings take place in Room 401, MI, Leiden University.

<p>
In this course we will treat at least 2 important methods/techniques in topology and
geometry: (1) <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_homology">singular homology</A>, 
(2) <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics)">sheaves</A> and 
 <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_cohomology">cohomology</A>. Both are aimed at
understanding the global properties of a topological space by analyzing how the
space is built up out of simple pieces. We shall try to emphasise both
formal/abstract properties and concrete examples. Part (1) consists of, as applications of the homology theory, a
discussion of the famous <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed_point_theorem">Brouwer fixpoint
theorem</A> in arbitrary dimension, and the <A 
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball">hairy ball theorem</A>.

<p> Part (1) will be based on Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of <A HREF="http://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jongrsde/olderteaching/algtop2011/algtop.pdf"> the lecture
notes `Algebraic topology'</A> by Prof. E. Looijenga. <BR>
Another very useful reference is Chapter II of A.Hatcher, <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">Algebraic Topology</a>, Cambridge University Press, 2002.

<p> Part (2) will be based on Chapter 4 of <A HREF="http://catalogus.leidenuniv.nl/F/8TTPLPMG8JGFHQX2XCLM3M4KHA5HHPK19CQEVNGS238RKKUYGP-00438?func=find-e&adjacent=N&find_scan_code=FIND_WRD&request=voisin+hodge+theory&local_base=LDN01W&x=0&y=0#show_3_0">C.Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex
Algebraic Geometry, I. Cambridge Studies in advanced mathematics 76.</A> <BR>
Another very useful reference is Sections II.1 and III.1,2 of R.Hartshorne, Algebraic
Geometry, Graduate Texts in Mathematics 52.

<p>
If time permits, we will treat another important subject 
in topology and geometry : <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space">covering spaces</A>. A possible reference for this
part is the book <A HREF=" http://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Cambridge-Studies-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0521888506">Galois groups and fundamental groups</A> (Sections 1.4 and 2.1--2.4) by Tamas Szamuely. A <A HREF="http://www.renyi.hu/~szamuely/publ.html">set of errata</A> is available at the author's website.

<p> Prerequisites: the local courses Algebra 1--2, Linear Algebra 1--2, Topology (or their equivalents).

<p> The solutions to the homework exercises will be graded ++ (very good), + (good), +- (not so good) or - (poor). After the course is over there will be an oral exam discussing a random subset of the semester's homework exercises or a written exam (to be decided later). The final grade (a half-integer between 1 and 10) is meant to reflect the student's performance on the semester's homework exercises, as well as her or his progression on these as measured during the oral/written exam.

<p> <span style="color:red">Optional languages for the exam are Dutch and English</span>. Each student can choose to take the exam in one of the two languages. The oral exam will take place on Jan. 12th and 13th. The course is worth 6 EC. <span style="color:red">Please send me an e-mail before Dec. 5th</span> if you want to take the oral exam and choose at the same time in which language you want to take the exam. If you have strong preference on the date, please also tell me in the e-mail.

<p> The teaching assistant of this course is Alexander Tonkelaar. Solutions to the homework sets need to be given to him; mailbox in the common room, or by email: a.tonkelaar AT umail.leidenuniv.nl. Some corrected homework sets (2nd, 3rd and 4th) can be found in my mailbox.

<p> Here is the <a href="./IAT_Fall_2014/exercisesSingHom.pdf">exercise sheet</a> for Part (1). This Exercise Sheet is updated on Oct. 16, 2014.
